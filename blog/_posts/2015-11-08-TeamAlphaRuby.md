Coaches

Barbara and Stella:  Our coaches worked with us throughout the Summer Project and also supported in weekends to fix issues in our Project. They have been supporting us  , help us during any issues and provide advise on the Project and goals , help  by providing guidance on the Project goals(milestones) . Learning is more important for us than building tons of features. 

Mentor(s)

Zachary Project maintainers/ core contributors  . He is our inspiration and we had an opportunity to work under his guidance. At any point of difficulty in the Project he was always  providing support and help to fix the issues  while working on  The  Official Ruby Documentation Redesign, .
Teams App

You will all be connected as a team via the Teams app. The supervisors are all now setting up their profiles and soon will be showing up on your teams-page. The Teams App will be the central connection hub with links to all project related repos, chats, blogs, etc.	
We communicated using SLACK Channel with our Team. We had a weekly status call with our Coaches , mentors and Supervisors.

Our experience and Our learning

We had 3 months spent for learning end coding  , exploring and hgaining knowledge in Open Source.
We are stepping out with so much  of positive  experience and  gained knowledge which help us further  shape our career.
Organizers of Rails Girls are an inspiration to me . We have no words to express our love for the Organizers .They have been supporting me during the most difficult phase of Our Project, Rails Girls is not possible without such amazing persons. I have learnt a lot from the Project personally and professionally on how to handle extreme situations.
